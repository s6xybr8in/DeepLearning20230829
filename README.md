***1. Introduction to Computer Vision***
   
학습이란 입력과 출력의 관계를 추론하는 것이다.
Meaning of “Learning” : Infer the relationship between input and output.

What they learned is that there are many types of cells in the, in the primary visual cortex part of the cat brain but on of the most important cell is the simple cells the respond to oriented edges when they move in certain directions. 
그들이 배운 것은 고양이 뇌의 주요 시각 피질 부분에 많은 종류의 세포가 있지만, 가장 중요한 세포에는 특정 방향으로 움직일 때 방향을 향하는 가장자리에 반응하는 단순한 세포가 있다는 것입니다.
 
The first step is what he calls “primal sketch”. This is where mostly the edges, the bar,the ends, the virtual lines, curves, the boundaries, are represented are the is very much inspired by what neuroscientists have seen: Hubel and Wiesel told us the early stage of visual processing has a lot o to do with simple structures like edges. 
Then the next step aftrer the edge and curves is what David marr calls two-and-a-half D sketch, this is where we start to piece togetger the surfaces, the depth information, the layers, or the discontinuities of the visual scene, and 
Then eventually we put everything together and have a 3d model hierarchically organized in terms of surface and volumetric primitives and so on.
So that was a very idealized thought process of what vision is and this way

Human began to ask the question how can we move beyond the simple block world and start recognizing or representing real world objects? 
First idea is “generalized cylinder, and next is “pictorial structure”

Object detection and Image Cationning
Is a little bit different.
Rather then classifying an entire image as a cat or a dog a horse or whatnot,
Instead we want to go in and draw bounding boxes and say that there is a dog here, and a cat here and draw these boxes describing where objects in the image.


We also talk about image captioning where given an image the system now needs to produce a natural language sentence  describing images.
It sounds like a really hard, complicated, and different problems ,but we’ll see  that many tof the tools that we develop in service of image classification will be reused in these other problems as well
